Login to PostgreSQL: Run the following command in your terminal to login to PostgreSQL as the postgres user:

bash
Copy code
sudo -u postgres psql
This will start the PostgreSQL interactive terminal program.

Connect to your database: In the PostgreSQL interactive terminal program, run the following command to connect to your shopmood database:

sql
Copy code
\c shopmood
View the contents of your table: You can view the contents of your products table with the following SQL command:

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM products;
This will display all rows from the products table.

Exit the PostgreSQL interactive terminal program: You can exit the PostgreSQL interactive terminal program by typing \q and pressing Enter.

Remember to replace shopmood with the name of your database, and products with the name of your table.
